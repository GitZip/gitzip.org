The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. -  See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf<br></div><div class='innerText'><br><strong>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</strong><br></div><div class='innerText'>Users can visit our site anonymously.</div><div class='innerText'>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.<br></div><div class='innerText'>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page specified above.</div><div class='innerText'><br>You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:</div><div class='innerText'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&bull;</strong> On our Privacy Policy Page<br></div><div class='innerText'>Can change your personal information:</div><div class='innerText'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&bull;</strong> No, because we do not have account system.</div><div class='innerText'><br><strong>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?</strong><br></div><div class='innerText'>We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place. </div><div class='innerText'><br><strong>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</strong><br></div><div class='innerText'>It's also important to note that we do not allow third-party behavioral tracking</div><span id='coppAct'></span><br><div class='blueText'><strong>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</strong></div><br /><div class='innerText'>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control.

This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</div> </div>
